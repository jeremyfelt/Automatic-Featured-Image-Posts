Automatic Featured Image Posts creates a new post with a Featured Image every time an image is uploaded.

== Description ==

Automatic Featured Image Posts creates a new post with a Featured Image every time an image is uploaded. Through the plugin settings page, you can set the image to publish and assign itself to one of your other existing custom post types and/or post formats.

The imagined use case is to make managing a large number of photos through WordPress a little more interesting and a little more fun.

After uploading 10, 100, or 1000 pictures from an event or vacation, you and other users can go through and spend the majority of your time adding content, tags, and titles to your photographs rather than going through a monotonous process creating new posts over and over again.

Settings are available for:

*  Default Post Status (draft, pending, published, private)
*  Default Post Type
    *  Default is the WordPress post.
    *  Can choose any custom post type registered in your WordPress installation.
*  Default Post Format
    *  Default is 'standard', which equates to none.
    *  Other options are provided if registered by your theme

Filters are available for:

*  'afip_new_post_title' = Allow other functions or themes to change the post title before creation.
*  'afip_new_post_category' = Allow other functions or themes to change the post categories before creation.
*  'afip_new_post_content' = Allow other functions or themes to change the post content before creation.
*  'afip_new_post_date' = Allow other functions or themes to change the post date before creation

== Installation ==

1.  Upload 'automatic-featured-image-posts' to your plugin directory, usually 'wp-content/plugins/', or install automatically via your WordPress admin page.
1.  Activate Automatic Featured Image Posts in your plugin menu.
1.  If you'd like to change the default post status or post type, configure the plugin using the Auto Image Posts menu under Settings in your admin page. (*See Screenshot*)

That's it!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why don't I see any of my images? The posts were created. =

*  More than likely the installed theme does not support featured images (post thumbnails). If this is the case, images are assigned to posts in the background, but there is no interface to display or edit them.
*  A warning will appear on your Automatic Featured Image Posts settings screen if it is detected that featured images are not enabled.

= Can you put the images in post content instead of setting them as a featured image? =

*  I can't, but you can with the included filters.
    * Check out the [writeup on the new filters] (http://www.jeremyfelt.com/wordpress/2012/04/14/filters-in-autâ€¦ed-image-posts "Filters in Automatic Featured Image Posts")
