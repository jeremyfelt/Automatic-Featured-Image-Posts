Automatic Featured Image Posts creates a new post with a Featured Image every time an image is uploaded.

== Description ==

Automatic Featured Image Posts creates a new post with a Featured Image every time an image is uploaded. Through the plugin settings page, you can set the image to publish and assign itself to one of your other existing custom post types.

The imagined use case is to make managing a large number of photos through WordPress a little more interesting and a little more fun.

After uploading 10, 100, or 1000 pictures from an event or vacation, you and other users can go through and spend the majority of your time adding content, tags, and titles to your photographs rather than going through a monotonous process creating new posts over and over again.

Settings are available for:

*  Default Post Status (draft, pending, published, private)
*  Default Post Type
    *  Default is the WordPress post.
    *  Can choose any custom post type registered in your WordPress installation.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'automatic-featured-image-posts' to your plugin directory, usually 'wp-content/plugins/', or install automatically via your WordPress admin page.
1. Activate Automatic Featured Image Posts in your plugin menu.
1. If you'd like to change the default post status or post type, configure the plugin using the Auto Image Posts menu under Settings in your admin page. (*See Screenshot*)

That's it!
