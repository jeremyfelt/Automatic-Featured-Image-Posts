Automatic Featured Image Posts creates a new post with a Featured Image every time an image is uploaded.

== Description ==

Automatic Featured Image Posts creates a new post with a Featured Image every time an image is uploaded.

The imagined use case is to make managing a large number of photos through WordPress a little more interesting and a little more fun.

After uploading 10, 100, or 1000 pictures from an event or vacation, you and other users can go through and spend the majority of your time adding content, tags, and titles to your photographs rather than going through a monotonous process creating new posts over and over again.

Settings are available for:
* Default Post Status (draft, pending, published, private)

More settings, including templates for post content, post titles, and custom post types are on their way in the near future.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'automatic-featured-image-posts' to your plugin directory, usually 'wp-content/plugins/', or install automatically via your WordPress admin page.
1. Activate Automatic Featured Image Posts in your plugin menu.
1. If you'd like to change the default post status, configure the plugin using the Auto Image Posts menu under Settings in your admin page. (*See Screenshot*)

That's it!
